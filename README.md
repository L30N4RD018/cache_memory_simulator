# Workshop 9

Write a Python script to resolve exercise 5.2, the script should be able to resolve any list of word addresses (the script should ask the user to provide it using the command line). For item 5.2.3, the program must identify the best cache design for the given list of word addresses and the reason for it

## 5.2 Caches are important to providing a high-performance memory hierarchy to processors. Below is a list of 64-bit memory address references, given as word addresses. 0x03, 0xb4, 0x2b, 0x02, 0xbf, 0x58, 0xbe, 0x0e, 0xb5, 0x2c, 0xba, 0xfd

## 5.2.1 [10] <§5.3> For each of these references, identify the binary word address, the tag, and the index given a direct-mapped cache with 16 one-word blocks. Also list whether each reference is a hit or a miss, assuming the cache is initially empty.

## 5.2.2 [10] <§5.3> For each of these references, identify the binary word address, the tag, the index, and the offset given a direct-mapped cache with two-word blocks and a total size of eight blocks. Also list if each reference is a hit or a miss, assuming the cache is initially empty.

## 5.2.3 [20] <§§5.3, 5.4> You are asked to optimize a cache design for the given references. There are three direct-mapped cache designs possible, all with a total of eight words of data: C1 has 1-word blocks, C2 has 2-word blocks, and C3 has 4-word blocks.
